# 🧠 Object Detection using YOLOv5

This project showcases the implementation of **real-time object detection** using the powerful and efficient **YOLOv5** (You Only Look Once) model developed by Ultralytics. YOLOv5 is renowned for its **speed, accuracy, and lightweight architecture**, making it ideal for applications that require real-time performance and versatility. 

The model is capable of detecting **multiple object classes** in both images and videos. This solution supports custom training, is optimized for fast inference, and produces output with **bounding boxes, class names, and confidence scores**.

Common use-cases include:
- 🚗 Autonomous Vehicles  
- 🧠 Smart Surveillance  
- 📦 Industrial Automation  
- 🚦 Traffic Analysis  
- 👁️ Visual Monitoring Systems
